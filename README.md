Advanced Projectile Motion Calculator

Welcome! This is a web app I built to make projectile motion less intimidating and more interactive. Whether you’re a student, engineer, or just curious about physics, this tool lets you explore how things fly through the air—and see how different variables change the outcome.

Features
	•	Customizable Inputs
	▫	Set initial velocity, launch angle, height, gravity, and wind speed
	▫	Toggle air resistance (with drag coefficient, area, mass, and air density)
	•	Detailed Outputs
	▫	Time of flight, maximum height, range, and final velocity (speed & angle)
	▫	Trajectory equation (if no air resistance)
	▫	Table of values (time, x, y, vx, vy)
	•	Interactive Graphs
	▫	Trajectory (y vs x)
	▫	Velocity vs. time (Vx and Vy)
	▫	Download graphs as PNG images
	•	Data Export
	▫	Download your simulation data as a CSV file
	•	Modern, Accessible UI
	▫	Clean, dark theme and responsive layout

How to Use
	1.	Open ‎⁠index.html⁠ in your browser. No installation or account needed.
	2.	Fill in the parameters. If you’re not sure what something means, try the defaults or hover for hints.
	3.	Click “Calculate.” See the results, graphs, and data table instantly.
	4.	Download your results. Export graphs as images or the raw data as a CSV for further analysis.

Physics, Explained
	•	No Air Resistance: The app uses classic physics formulas for parabolic motion, so you get exact answers.
	•	With Air Resistance: It switches to a numerical method (Euler’s method), which simulates drag and gives you a more realistic flight path.
	•	Wind: Wind speed is added to the initial horizontal velocity, so you can see how a tailwind or headwind changes things.

Why I Built This

I love seeing how math and physics play out visually. I wanted a tool that didn’t just spit out numbers, but actually showed what’s happening step by step. If you get distracted (like I do), the graphs and tables help you stay engaged and spot patterns quickly.

Accessibility & Neurodiversity
	•	Clear language and labels
	•	No hidden steps
	•	Immediate feedback (see changes as soon as you hit Calculate)
	•	Dark mode by default (easier on the eyes)
	•	Downloadable results for offline review or sharing

Tech Stack
	•	HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	•	Chart.js ↗ for plotting
